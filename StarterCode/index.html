          <h2>Correlations Discovered</h2>
          <h3>In Poverty (%) vs Obese(%)</h3>
          <p>There is a slight upstream trend one can see form the graph. There could be a correlation between the Poverty (%) and the Obese(%).
            Factors that may affect the trend might be that having a healthy diet or access to a health instructor is more expensive and less accessible
            for people with lower income and probably want to save up that money for more vital stuff they might need.
          </p>
            <h3>In Poverty (%) vs Smokes(%)</h3>
            <p>One can see an upstream trend correlation between the Poverty (%) and the smokers. So, one could say that the higher the
              Poverty (%), the most likely is that state to have a higher smoking rate. Some factors that may come to may that could affect
            is that in poverty has an obvious effect on a person's happiness, more so in a country like the US, so seeking compensators through
          other ways may cause more people to find smoking as a way to help them get through. </p>
            <h3>In Poverty (%) vs Lacks Healthcare (%)</h3>
            <p>This one was probably the most painful one. This one is the scatter plot with the highest upstream slope out of the 3 poverty realted 
              plots, as we know; The US health system is very not perfect, and one of the defects is that is very expensive. This hits the people with
              lower incomes the hardest. So, one could say that the higher the poverty(%), the less likely is that one has Healthcare.
            </p>
          <h3>Age (median) vs Obese(%)</h3>
          <p>It's interesting to see that most of obese percentages can go between an age median from 34 to 44 years. So maybe there is a 
            correlation between something that happens at the age of 34-44 that makes people more prone to obesity. However; those factors
            cannot be determined with the data available.
          </p>
          <h3>Age (median) vs Smokes(%)</h3>
          <p> Much like the past one, the age demographic seems to be constituted mainly of people between 34 and 44 years. Nevertheless, there seems to be 
            almost no correlation between the age median and the smoke (%), the only bit of resemblance to a correlation is that the lowest smoking(%) is the
            lower end, and the highest smoking rate is on the higher end. But otherwise, the plot doesn't seem to follow a trend.
          </p>
          <h3>Age (median) vs Lacks Healthcare (%)</h3>
          <p> This one is actually a very downstream trend that tells us that the older the citizen is, the less likely that person is to have Healthcare. 
            I'll just be honest and say that I cannot give resonable factors as to what is the possible reason behind this trend other that mere speculation.
          </p>
          <h3> Household income (median) vs Obese(%)</h3>
          <p>So this makes sense seeing how the counterpart of this plot went. The higher the income, the more likely the possibility to have access to a healthy diet
            and health support from experts. So, the higher the income, the less likely is the person to be obese.
          </p>
          <h3> Household income (median) vs Smokes(%)</h3>
          <p> Guess that I could say the same thing I did from the In Poverty (%) vs Smokes(%) plot. The plot follows a downstream trend that tells us;
            That the higher the icome, the less likely the person is to smoke. Wich could be due to happiness issues. However, is does seem that it mantains a level of smokers
            of about of 10 at all levels.
          </p>
          <h3> Household income (median) vs Lacks Healthcare (%)</h3>
          <p>
            One can see that the plot is a downstream trend wich tells us that the higher the Household income, the less likely is the Household to lack Healthcare. Of course that 
            is because those people are more likely to be able to afford it.
