          <h2>Correlations Discovered</h2>
          <h3>In Poverty (%) vs Obese(%)</h3>
          <p>There is a slight upstream trend </p>
            <h3>In Poverty (%) vs Smokes(%)</h3>
            <p>One can see an upstream trend correlation between the Poverty (%) and the smokers. So, one could say that the higher the
              Poverty (%), the most likely is that state to have a higher smoking rate. Some factors that may come to may that could affect
            is that in poverty has an obvious effect on a person's happiness, more so in a country like the US, so seeking compensators through
          other ways may cause more people to find smoking as a way to help them get through, same idea as the last graph, but the people with that
          live on a state with low poverty (%) are significally less likely to smoke. </p>
            <h3>In Poverty (%) vs Lacks Healthcare (%)</h3>
            <p>Pellentesque habitant morbi tristique senectus et netus et malesuada fames ac turpis egestas. Vestibulum tortor
            quam, feugiat vitae, ultricies eget, tempor sit amet, ante. Donec eu libero sit amet quam egestas semper. Aenean
            ultricies mi vitae est. Mauris placerat eleifend leo.</p>
          <h3>Age (median) vs Obese(%)</h3>
          <p>It's interesting to see that most of obese percentages can go between an age median from 34 to 44 years. So maybe there is a 
            correlation between something that happens at the age of 34-44 that makes people more prone to obesity. However; those factors
            cannot be determined with the data available.
